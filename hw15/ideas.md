A proof-of-concept game for the core functions and designs of an RP game, based off of the gameplay and technology of MMORPGs (with obvious exceptions, such as lack of 3d graphics and small scale), for example (the often looked down upon) [Runescape](http://runescape.com), focusing on the server-client interaction and technologies allowing gameplay to be synced across multiple users and geographic locations.

### Genre
MMMORPG (Mini-MMORPG, (yes, that is a mini-massive)), adventure roleplay.

### Technical Hurdles
 * Server-client interaction and syncing (making all clients see as similar a game as possible)
 * Designing a model of game components that can be scaled at any time with little effort.
